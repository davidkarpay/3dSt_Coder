Given your goals and the complexity of this project, I'd strongly recommend VS Code for the following reasons:
üéØ Why VS Code is Best for This Project
1. Complex Multi-File Project Management

You're building a ~40+ file project with intricate dependencies
VS Code excels at navigating large codebases with its file explorer, search, and "Go to Definition" features
The outline view and breadcrumbs make it easy to understand the architecture

2. Python Development Features

Python extension provides excellent IntelliSense, debugging, and linting
Jupyter notebook support for testing your LLM inference
Integrated terminal for running Poetry commands and tests
Virtual environment management built-in

3. Essential Extensions for Your Stack
json{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
    "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "ms-vscode.makefile-tools",
    "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
    "redhat.vscode-yaml",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml",
    "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker",
    "GitHub.copilot"  // If you have access
  ]
}
4. Debugging Capabilities

Set breakpoints in your ReAct agent loop
Step through tool executions
Inspect memory and LLM responses
Debug FastAPI endpoints directly

5. Git Integration

Visual diff viewer for reviewing changes
Branch management
Commit history
Conflict resolution tools

ü§ñ When to Use Claude Code
Claude Code would be better for:

Quick scripts or single-file tools
Rapid prototyping of individual components
Generating boilerplate code quickly
Refactoring existing code with AI assistance

You could use Claude Code to:
bash# Generate individual tools quickly
claude-code "Create a legal document parser tool that extracts case citations"

# Refactor existing code
claude-code "Add async support to this file" --file tools/legal_parser.py

# Generate tests
claude-code "Write comprehensive tests for the ReAct agent"
üèÜ My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach
Use VS Code as your primary IDE with this workflow:

VS Code for:

Main development environment
Debugging and testing
Project navigation
Git operations
Running the application


Claude Code for:

Generating new tools/components
Writing test cases
Refactoring suggestions
Documentation generation


Terminal/CLI for:

Poetry dependency management
Docker operations
Running benchmarks
Deployment scripts



üìù VS Code Setup for Your Project
Create this workspace settings file:
json// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
    "tests",
    "-v",
    "--cov=."
  ],
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.organizeImports": true
  },
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/__pycache__": true,
    "**/*.pyc": true,
    ".pytest_cache": true,
    ".coverage": true
  }
}
And launch configurations:
json// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "API Server",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "uvicorn",
      "args": [
        "api.main:app",
        "--reload",
        "--port", "8000"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "CLI Chat",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cli.py",
      "args": ["chat"],
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Run Tests",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "pytest",
      "args": ["-v"]
    }
  ]
}
üöÄ Quick Start in VS Code

Open VS Code and clone the project:

bash   git clone <your-repo>
   code coding-agent

Install recommended extensions when prompted
Open integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``) and run:

bash   ./setup.sh

Use the Run and Debug panel (F5) to start the API server
Use Claude Code in the terminal for quick generations:

bash   # While in VS Code terminal
   claude-code "Add a legal document summarizer tool"
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: a powerful IDE for complex development and AI assistance for rapid code generation!
